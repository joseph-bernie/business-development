	    	<h3>Introduction to Technologies used in this Website</h3>
				<br />
			<p>All language technologies are written by the web developer on a source code editor creating individual files. Each file is written in a markup, scripting or programming language containing individual file extensions. Each is an individual language with different protocols. All files are linked together through inline tags and work in conjunction to create the overall websites appearance and functionality. All files are delivered to the Web Browser via HTTP(a transfer protocol for hypertext) linking the World Wide Web.</p>
			<h5>Hypertext Markup Language</h5>
			<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by CSS and JavaScript; the three core Web technologies. HTML uses tags to define elements within a document. In web design and development the two most popular markup languages are HTML and XML. </p>
			<h5>Cascading Style Sheets</h5>
			<p>CSS written in style sheet language is used to describe the appearance of HTML's format. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. It is also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.</p> 
			<h5>JavaScript</h5>
			<p>JS is a high-level scripting and client-side programming language used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. JavaScript helps web developers to make web pages dynamic and interactive by implementing custom client-side scripts. JavaScript can create complex Web pages that behave like desktop software applications.</p>
			<h5>Hypertext Preprocessor</h5>
			<p>PHP is an open source, server-side, scripting language used for the development of web applications. It is a general-purpose programming language. In computer software, a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains (a general-purpose language). A general-purpose programming language has this status because it does not include language constructs designed to be used within a specific application domain. </p>
			<h5>Extensible Markup Language</h5>
			<p>XML is a language for designing specialized markup languages. Extensible meaning it allows users to create their own markup to describe content, making an unlimited and self-defining markup set. Each contian a Document Type Definition (DTD) which is a collection of rules defining the content and structure of a valid document in that category. They also contain a Schema file (XSD) used in conjunction with XML and DTD that contains validation rules for allowed content.</p>
